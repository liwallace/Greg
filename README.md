# Greg
Greg's Test Repository for Testing C#.  Greg let's see if you can do the following steps:

Git clone (copy code link out of github)

git checkout -b "your_branch_name" (if doesnâ€™t exist creates a new branch )

git commit -m "creating branch" (adds newly created branch to github)

Once you have your branch and see that it is in GitHub do the following:

Create a file on your filesystem where you cloned the code.

git add .   (Add all of your files after you have added them in explorer or modified the code in Visual Code)

git commit -m "checking in selenium demo" (commits to local branch and stages to push to repo.)

git push origin lisa-selenium (adds your changes to the repo stored in GitHub)

Open git Hub and review changes and request pull request.

Once pull request is approved select squash and merge

After that completes successfully delete your branch.

Git branch -D <branch> -deletes regardless of merge warnings
  
Now you have all the steps needed to check in code to a new branch.
